# Why I made this?

- I'm learning Front-End Web Development and want to have practice, because I made this little work. It was realy interested to work. Have little difficulties with Buttons, but everything is done. It's almos Pixel Perfect, with little differences. I know it's not professional work, but I think for beginner, it's pretty good.

# How I made this?

- For this work I used HTML5 and CSS3, in pure state. For this time I'm not familiar with any Framework or PreProcessors.
